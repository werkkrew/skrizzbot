# Introduction #

My fork of the phenny/jenni/willie Python IRC bot.  Using this bot as a platform for learning some python as well as having a fun bot which is easy to extend in functionality.

# Documentation #

I have not included the original documentation here as I will eventually need to re-write it to accomodate the project rename but most of the [Willie](http://willie.dftba.net/) documentation still applies and is accurate.
