# Introduction #

An attempt at a "from scratch" Python IRC bot.  I am drawing from phenny/jinni/willie for inspiration for this bot.  Attempting to write from scratch for the purpose of learning python.

# Credits #

Since I am using the following Python bots as most of my insiration for how to build this bot, I am going to give them formal credit here.  I did not fork one of these projects because I want to write my bot from scratch for the sake of learning Python but since I really like the way these bots are architected I am certain my bot will end up looking very similar to them.
